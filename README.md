# VLSI-design-4-bit-ALU
Designing a 4-bit ALU in the verilog, ngspice and MAGIC VLSI design technologies. The project includes transistor level design of the ALU using MAGIC and also consists of the delay analysis through the circuit for each operation of the ALU.
The delays in the sub-circuits are automated by python scripts.
